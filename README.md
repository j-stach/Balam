ML model from scratch (WIP)

This project follows the machine learning model outlined in _Neural Networks from Scratch in Python_, by Kinsley and Kukiela, but in Rust.

The end goal is to create a mobile app capable of scanning, interpreting, and translating Mayan glyphs into English *via* the smartphone camera.
